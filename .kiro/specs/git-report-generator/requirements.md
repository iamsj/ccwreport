# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic generation of daily, weekly, and monthly reports by analyzing git commit logs and other data sources. The system uses AI to process raw data and generate formatted reports in markdown or HTML format, with configurable data sources, AI models, and output formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple git repositories as data sources, so that I can generate reports from all my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user configures a git data source THEN system SHALL store project address, username, and time range settings
2. WHEN user adds multiple git repositories THEN system SHALL support multiple concurrent data source configurations
3. WHEN user specifies time range THEN system SHALL validate and store the date range for data collection
4. IF git repository requires authentication THEN system SHALL securely store and use credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure different report types (daily, weekly, monthly), so that I can generate reports for different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects report type THEN system SHALL support daily, weekly, and monthly report generation
2. WHEN generating report THEN system SHALL use appropriate time range based on report type
3. WHEN user configures report settings THEN system SHALL store preferences for future use
4. IF report type is weekly THEN system SHALL generate report for the past 7 days
5. IF report type is monthly THEN system SHALL generate report for the past 30 days

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose output format (markdown or HTML), so that I can use the reports in different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user selects output format THEN system SHALL support both markdown and HTML generation
2. WHEN no format is specified THEN system SHALL default to markdown format
3. WHEN generating HTML THEN system SHALL create properly formatted HTML with appropriate styling
4. WHEN generating markdown THEN system SHALL use standard markdown syntax

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure AI model settings and prompts, so that I can customize how the reports are generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user configures AI settings THEN system SHALL store API keys, model selection, and connection parameters
2. WHEN user customizes prompts THEN system SHALL allow modification of AI prompts for different report types
3. WHEN AI processing fails THEN system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
4. IF custom prompt is provided THEN system SHALL use it instead of default prompt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically collect git log data and process it with AI, so that I can generate comprehensive reports without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report generation is triggered THEN system SHALL fetch git log data from configured repositories
2. WHEN git data is collected THEN system SHALL filter commits based on configured time range and username
3. WHEN data processing begins THEN system SHALL send git log data to configured AI model with appropriate prompts
4. WHEN AI processing completes THEN system SHALL format the response according to selected output format
5. IF git repository is inaccessible THEN system SHALL log error and continue with available data sources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to extend the system with other data sources in the future, so that I can generate more comprehensive reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system is designed THEN architecture SHALL support pluggable data source extensions
2. WHEN new data source is added THEN system SHALL maintain consistent configuration and processing patterns
3. WHEN multiple data sources are configured THEN system SHALL aggregate data from all sources for report generation
4. IF data source fails THEN system SHALL continue processing with remaining available sources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and reuse configurations, so that I can quickly generate reports with my preferred settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user creates configuration THEN system SHALL persist all settings for future use
2. WHEN user loads saved configuration THEN system SHALL restore all previously configured settings
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN system SHALL save changes automatically or prompt user to save
4. IF configuration file is corrupted THEN system SHALL provide default settings and notify user
